Arduino Basics with Tinkercad Circuits üöÄ
A beginner-friendly collection of fundamental Arduino projects, all simulated in Autodesk Tinkercad Circuits. This repository is the perfect starting point for students, hobbyists, and anyone new to electronics, offering a hands-on learning experience without requiring any physical hardware.

üéØ About This Repository

This repository is designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice. By using Tinkercad's powerful simulation environment, you can build, code, and test Arduino projects directly in your browser. Each project folder contains well-commented C++ code (.ino files) that is ready to be pasted into a Tinkercad circuit.

The curriculum starts with simple concepts like blinking an LED and gradually progresses to more complex topics, including sensor integration, serial communication, and multitasking principles.

Core Concepts Covered:

Digital I/O: Controlling LEDs and reading button presses (Pull-up/Pull-down).

Analog I/O: Reading analog sensors like potentiometers and temperature sensors.

Pulse Width Modulation (PWM): Fading LEDs and controlling motor speed.

Sensors: Interfacing with PIR, Ultrasonic, and Temperature sensors.

Serial Communication: Sending and receiving data between the Arduino and a computer (UART).

Communication Protocols: A beginner's look into I2C communication.

Control Logic: Building projects like a Traffic Light Controller and implementing multitasking concepts.

‚ú® Key Features
Zero Hardware Required: Learn electronics and programming entirely through simulation.

Beginner-Focused: Simple, clear, and well-documented code examples.

Interactive Learning: See your code come to life in a virtual circuit.

Wide Range of Topics: Covers all the essential concepts needed to get started with Arduino.

Perfect for Education: An excellent resource for classroom teaching, workshops, or self-study.
